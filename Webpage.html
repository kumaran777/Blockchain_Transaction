		    <h2>"What is BlockChain?"</h2>
		    <p>Blockchain is the latest technology trend to follow in the wake of IoT and AI and promises a new model for traceability,<br> supply chain transparency, compliance monitoring and auditability.</p>
	   
	</section>
	   <section class="Corecomponent">
	   	    <h2>"Core Components of Blockchain Architecture:"</h2>
	   	    <p>These are the core blockchain architecture components:<br>
			<b>Node</b> - "user or computer within the blockchain architecture (each has an independent copy of the whole blockchain ledger)."<br>
			<b>Transaction</b> - "smallest building block of a blockchain system (records, information, etc.) that serves as the purpose of blockchain."<br>
			<b>Block</b> - "a data structure used for keeping a set of transactions which is distributed to all nodes in the network."<br>
			<b>Chain</b> - "a sequence of blocks in a specific order."<br>
			<b>Miners</b> - "specific nodes which perform the block verification process before adding anything to the blockchain structure."<br>
			<b>Consensus</b>(consensus protocol) - "a set of rules and arrangements to carry out blockchain operations."</p>
	   	</section>
	   	<section class="Cryptography">
	   		<h2>"What is Cryptography?"</h2>
	   		<p>"<b>Cryptography</b> is the practice of developing protocols that prevent third parties from viewing private data."<br>
			<b>Encryption:</b> Encoding text into an unreadable format.<br>
			<b>Decryption:</b> Reserving encryption – converting a jumbled message into its original form.<br>
			<b>Cipher:</b> An algorithm for performing encryption or decryption, usually a well-defined set of steps that can be followed.<br>
			<b>Cryptography before the modern age was synonymous to encryption –</b> the process of converting information from a readable format to something that makes no sense.<br> Encryption techniques date back as far as the ancient Egyptians, and have roots spanning all throughout history.<br>
			<b>For example,</b> the Caesar Cipher is a famous cipher used by Julius Caesar to securely communicate with his generals.<br> The cipher “shifts” each letter in a message by a certain amount – with a shift of 2, A would become C, B would become D, and so on.<br>
			<b>Blockchain technology makes use of cryptography in multiple different ways – </b>for wallets, transactions, security, and privacy-preserving protocols.<br> This article will cover some important cryptography topics that relate to blockchain technology including public-key cryptography, hashing, and Merkle trees.</p>
	   	</section>
	   	<section class="Public-Key">
	   		<h2>"Public-Key Cryptography?"</h2>
	   		<p>"<b>Public-key cryptography</b>(also called asymmetric cryptography) is a cryptographic system that uses a pair of keys – a public key and a private key."<br> The public key may be widely distributed, but the private key is meant to be known only by its owner.<br> Keys are always created in a pair – every public key must have a corresponding private key.<br>
			Public-key cryptography is most often used for encrypting messages between two people or two computers in a secure way.<br> Anyone can use someone’s public key to encrypt a message, but once encrypted,<br> the only way to decrypt that message is by using the corresponding private key.<br>
			<h3>Let’s say Alice wants to send an encrypted message to Bob.</h3>
			<b>It would work like this:</b><br>
			<b>1.</b>Alice uses Bob’s public key to encrypt the message.<br>
			"Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob – if a third party intercepted it, all they would see is random numbers and letters."<br>
			<b>2.</b>Bob uses his private key to decrypt and read the message.</p>
	   	</section>
	   	<section class="Hashing">
	   		<h2>"Cryptographic Hashing?"</h2>
	   		<p>"<b>Cryptographic hashing</b> is another fundamental piece of blockchain technology and is directly responsible for producing immutability<br>– one of blockchain’s most important features."<br>
			Hashing is a computer science term that means taking an input string of any length and producing a fixed length output.<br> It doesn’t matter if the input to a certain hash function is 3 or 100 characters, the output will always be the same length.<br>
			<h3>Cryptographic hash functions are hash functions that have these crucial properties:</h3><br>
			<b>Deterministic:</b> No matter how many times you give the function a specific input, it will always have the same output.<br>
			<b>Irreversible:</b> It is impossible to determine an input from the output of the function.<br>
			<b>Collision resistance:</b> No two inputs can ever have the same output.<br>
			Another important feature of cryptographic hash functions is that changing any bit of data in the input will drastically alter the output.<br> For example, the hash outputs of <b>"111111"</b> and <b>"111112"</b> would be completely unique and have no relation to each other.</p>
	   	</section>
	   	<section class="Merkle">
	   		<h2>"Merkle Trees?"</h2>
	   		<p>"<b>Merkle tree </b>(or hash tree) is a tree that utilizes cryptographic hash functions to store hash outputs instead of raw data in each node.<br> Each leaf node consists of a cryptographic hash of its original data,<br> and every parent node is a hash of the combination of its child node hashes."</p>
